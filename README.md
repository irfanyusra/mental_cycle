# Mental Cycle
An app that allows you to track fluctuations in your mental state, and remind you of the good times when you're having a rough day.

## Inspiration
As a team of computer science students, our academic lives tend to get stressful, and the state of our happiness can vary a lot during this time. We wanted to create an app to help us remember the good times, and to remind us that even if our lives seem like they're falling apart, it will always get better.

## What it does
Our app asks the user to rate their day on a scale of 1 to 5 every day, along with a little description of why that particular day was good or bad. Using this data, we show the user a graph showing the trends of the user's mood over time. There is also a dedicated tab to remind the user of all their good days.

## How we built it
We built it using Material UI components for React.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble getting the client to communicate properly with the server, so due to time constraints, we were forced to store all of the user's info locally.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For our team, this was our very first progressive web app. We're very proud of how clean the final product turned out, and we're also proud of the skills we gained doing this project.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about web app design, and we became more aware of mental health issues by doing this project.

## What's next for Mental Cycle
The next step for Mental Cycle is to provide a secure way to for the user to share data with their therapist, and to provide therapists analytic tools to gain better insights into a patient's state of mind. We are also interested in integrating with Apple Health, enabling the user to track their mental health along with their physical one.
